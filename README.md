# jumpKnight_route
1. employed dfs to solve the typical problem: with 
one white knight and several black pawns on board, calculate
the appropriate route so that the white knight finishes
one of the pawns every single move and ultimately finishes
all.
2. employ python-chess library,to install which simply
apply
    ```cmd
    pip install python-chess
    ```
